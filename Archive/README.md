# Mod Archive
A bunch of either source reconstructed mods that I gave up on (or are obsolete), or my own creation which I discontinued.

### [Mine] AddDialogue
A standalone (inferior) feature-mod of mine, which I have no interest in maintaining

### [Decompiled] bgToolbox
Source reconstructed & Google Translated ModCode. The in-game interface unfortunately has Chinese text written in the custom Unity assets, which I have no interest (learning how to properly) dissect/translate/repack.

### [Decompiled] chName
Mod with custom Unity assets (e.g. buttons and textbox) for name changing. Since I've created my own name changing feature that's superior over this project, it is now on the list.

### [Decompiled] GiveAdvice
A (probably horribly) outdated mod with incorrectly defined text.

### [Decompiled] LuciferModifier
A Google translated fairly good MelonLoader cheat interface mod which doesn't really offer features that I don't already have. So I wasn't in the mood to reshape the UI for the 'less compact' English words and sentences.

### [Decompiled] Malware
A cursed NSFW mod that's locked behind paywall, which is driven by ModCode which I wanted to verify whether it's malware or not. *(Conclusion: It wasn't directly malware, but it does 'kindly' asks you to give out your Steam ID and MAC address)*

### [Mine] StandaloneQuest
My creation which was part of the Overlord mod. Since I have no interest in maintaining multiple copies, it's now on this list.

### [Mine] termFix
An attempt to make the in-game mod creator accept non-harmful English words. At the end, the data that I tried to patch turned out to **only** handle the info-message. Not the actual censorship.

### [Decompiled] tlRCB
By far the most cursed NSFW mod ever created, but the code quality (e.g. Event listener handling) is the best that I've seen. But that said: Although my source project could successfully build without errors, I've never even finished Google translating or test running it, cause the English variable names making me constant rage quit. *(The name stands for 'translated'RCB, with RCB being the name-abbreviation that I originally received along with the mod.)*
