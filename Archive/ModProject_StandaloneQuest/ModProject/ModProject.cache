{"soleID":"GLChvD","createTicks":638482933735624046,"name":"[Patch] Vanilla Quest limitations","author":"Cyfire","desc":"This mod is a standalone collection of patches to the vanilla game's many quest-related dialogues and events. (These patches will become part of 'Rise of The Overlord' in future releases)\r\n\r\nWhat this mod DOES NOT DO is:\r\nLet you survive scripted instant-kill effects or kill enemies that are scripted-invulnerable. For those feats you'll have to add different mods.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this mod are:\r\n[1. Bypass invulnerable enemies & scripted death]\r\n- Xingtian 1st encounter\r\n- Xingtian 2nd encounter\r\n- Hengtian at the top of Tian Yuan mountain\r\nAdditional Drama Triggers are added/injected to allow for passing these battles, which will lock you up if the ' normally unkillable boss' had died.\r\n\r\n[2. Slight dialogue changes (only)]\r\n- The Three-Legged Crow quest: If you legitimately defeated the birds.\r\n- Alchemy Temple: If you're immune to the Surging Yang Poison.\r\n- Sage Tianbao: Injected dialogue to mock him for having scripted immortality.\r\nUnlike with the first three boss encounters, these 3 encounters are just dialogue changes.\r\n\r\n[3. Immortal Shrines cheats/QoL]\r\n- Jade Blossom: Available in every month of the year, not just December.\r\n- Iridescent Cat: Marked all correct answers with blue text.\r\n- Outlandish One: World tour lasts 1 month instead of 3.\r\n- Noble Medic: You don't need the negative \"Wounded\" status.\r\n- Ethereal Illusion: The Muqing music lesson quest progresses 1 month for every step you take on the world map.\r\n- Shadowslayer: Get her destiny, even if you fail the gamble.\r\n- Placid Water: The hunter game's durations are multiplied x10, and in each difficulty you'll only have to catch 1 deer.\r\n- Destiny Catcher: Get the Shard of Heavenly Stone by purchasing just 1 item from his shop.\r\n- Gleaming Pieces: Marked correct answers with blue text.\r\n- Kunwu: Only need to own the title \"World No. 1 Sword Cultivator\", no need to equip it.\r\n- Stele of Sword: Nullified the 12-month duration. (You can spam-gain Sword stats)\r\n\r\n\r\n[4. Other cheats/QoL improvements]\r\n- Added option to skip to Agar's suicide scene at the Nether mountains, by 'punching' him towards the sun.\r\n- Walk quicker in battle instances within Tian Yuan mountain.\r\n- Completely skip the Geomancy puzzle from Jo's Tian Yuan mountain quest.\r\n- The heresy e.g. Taoist Mind Pavillion vs Mindsnap Temple questline's part that takes 6 months of waiting is now 1 month.\r\n- The part of Iron Shard Hunt at Duality village triggers in 1 month.\r\n- 5x Soul Lure obtained from Fallen Valley","ver":"v 1.0.0","autoSave":true,"isCreateNPC":true,"exportVer":1,"accountID":202480695,"publishedFileID":3217699790,"visibleState":0,"openCode":1,"curUpdateDesc":"Init release","tags":["Drama","English","Function"],"addPreviewPaths":["","","","",""],"excelEncrypt":true}
