- I've extracted all Json files from ModExportData.cache into ModExcel
- None of the ModExcel files are translated
- Visual Studio project has been reconstructed and successfully built.

Haven't tried local exporting & running the mod, cause I'm missing this mod's Config.json. You'll have to pray that it works XD

IMPORTANT!!
From the source code, I've made the following 2 variable changes (and quit after those 2)
"堕落值" = "corruption_val"
"淫女欲" = "nymphomaniac"

You'll have to Ctrl+F your "Config.json" file to see if those 2 strings are key names. If so, you can replace all.
